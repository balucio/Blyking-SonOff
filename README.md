# SonoffBoilerplate - Slightly changed

This is a replacement firmware (Arduino IDE with ESP8266 core needed) for the ESP8266 based Sonoff devices. Use it as a starting block for customizing your Sonoff.

Actually this is same code of original *tzapu/SonoffBoilerplate* but use BlynkSimpleEsp8266 library (https://github.com/khoih-prog/Blynk_WM) to handle Wifi configuration.

It also handle correctly sensor *hostname*

Please note that is tested with ESP8266 Arduino Board version >=2.7.4


OTA Actually is disabled
